Oh my god! I read this book in high school
It is so nice to see the books I read in school again. 
wow! I may reread this book.
I saw a New York map there (on the top of the shelf), so I am wondering if these all written by author from New York, or they just put it random there.
I think there are a lot of books you just remember for school and never rethink of them. So, it just cool there are here, and then I get to remember when i was younger and how good the books are.
I like how they used hard cover book, and interesting font on the side. The Size is nice for my eyes.

I guess this is where you just like read stuff                                              
Oh my gush
